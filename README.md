to use your own picture, replace the path that I have put in on line 94 with the path of the file you want to use
click run, the first picture that will come up is an image with the sobel filter implemented with the seam displayed
in white, for the images i have use, a lot of the time the first seams are right on the right border and trail off
at the bottom. when you exit out of this image, the grayscale picture will then appear with the seam taken out of the
image
